- description includes the following:
    - session name and purpose
    - time(s) the session is active
    - the media comprising the session
    - information needed to receive those media (addresses, ports, formats, etc..)
    - optional:
        - information about the bandwidth used in the session
        - contact information for the person responsible for the session
    - type of media (video, audio, etc.)
    - transport protocol (RTP/UDP/IP, H.320, etc)
    - format of the media (H.261 video, MPEG video)
    - multicast IP
        - multicast group address
        - transport port
    - unicast IP
        - remote address
        - remote transport port
- session-level section, followed by zero or more media-level sections
    - session-level starts with a v= line and continues to the first media-level section
    - each media-level section starts with a m= line and continues to the next media-level section of end of the whole session desc
    - in general, session-level values are the default for all media unless overridden by an equivalent media-level value

*=optional

- version
    - v=0
- origin
    - o=<username> <session id> <session version> <nettype> <addrtype> <unicast-address>
    - username - username or "-"
    - session id - numeric string tuple of o line forms a globally unique identifier for the session, can use NTP format timestamp
    - session version - up to creating tool, so long as increased when a modification is made to the session data, recommended that NTP format timestamp is used
    - nettype - IN defined as internet
    - addrtype - text string givign type of address IP4, IP6
    - unicast-address - full domain name or global IP
- session name
    - s=
    - textual, 1 per session description, if no name, use " "
- session info
    - i=
    - textual, 1 per session desc, at most 1 per media (likely to be used when there are multiple media streams of the same type)
- URI
    - u=
    - pointer to additional information aout the session
- email and phone number
    - e=, p=
    - more than one of each can be given
    - phone number 'should' start with a +, can have spaces
    - both can have optional free text in parenthesis or have free text then <number> or <email>
        - ex: e=j.doe@example.com (Jane Doe)
        - ex: e=Jane Doe <j.doe@example.com>
- connection data
    - c=<nettype> <addrtype> <connection-address>
    - must contain one c field in each media description or a single c field at the session level
    - may contain session level c field and additional c fields per media desc
    - nettype - IN
    - addrtype - IP4, IP6
    - connection address - IP address (+ optional ttl [0-255])
- bandwidth
    - b=<bwtype>:<bandwidth>
    - bwtype - CT - conference total, session-level, AS - appication specific
    - bandwidth iterpreted as kilobits per second by default
- timing
    - t=<start-time> <end-time>
    - decimal representation of NTP time values in seconds since 1900, to convert to UNIx, subtract decimal 2208988800
    - if stoptime set to 0, the session is not bounded, though it should not become active until after the start time, if start time also 0, session is regarded as perminent
- repeat times
    - r=<repeat interval> <active duration> <offsets from start-time>
    - all fields in seconds or:
        - d - days (86400 seconds)
        - h - hours (3600 seconds)
        - m - minutes (60 seconds)
        - s - seconds
- time zones
    - z=<adjustment time> <offset> <adjustment time> <offset> .......
    - adjustment time - in NTP time
    - offset - seconds or X days,hours, minutes to shift
- encryption keys
    - k=<method>
    - k=<method>:<encryption key>
    - if secure and trusted, MAY use encryption key
    - before media desc or for each media entry as required
    - clear:XXX only over secure channel
    - base64:XXX only over secure channel
    - uri:XXX uri refering to the key, can provide additional authentication
- attributes
    - a=<attribute>
    - a=,attribute>:<value>
    - primary means for extending SDP
    - session-level or media-level
    - either the attribute is boolean, or attribute has value
    - unknown attributes ignored
- media descriptions
    - m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...
    - media - media type - audio, video, text, application, message
    - port - transport port
    - proto - transport protocol, udp = unspecified over udp, RTP/AVP or RTP/SAVP
    - fmt - media format descroption
        - if proto=RTP fmt contains RTP payload type numbers. When a list of
        payload type numbers is given, this implies that all of these
        payload formats MAY be used in the session, but the first of these
        formats SHOULD be used as the default format for the session.  For
        dynamic payload type assignments the "a=rtpmap:" attribute
        - if proto=udp fmt must reference a media type describing the format under the top level media type. It should define the packet format
